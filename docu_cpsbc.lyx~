\begin_layout Subsection
Sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use data from the March Current Population Survey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to construct median lifetime earnings by cohort and school level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Filter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our sample contains men between the ages of 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsAgeMin$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsAgeMax$
\end_inset

 observed in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsYearFirst-\cpsYearLast$
\end_inset

 waves of the CPS.
 We drop persons who live in group quarters or who fail to report wage income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also drop: not wage and salary workers or in armed forces.
 Hours worked < 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsHoursMin$
\end_inset

.
 Weeks worked < 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsWeeksMin$
\end_inset

.
 No school information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observations are weighted by WTSUPP which excludes the armed forces and
 the Hispanic oversample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Schooling Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Schooling is inconsistently coded across surveys.
 Prior to 1992, we have information about completed years of schooling (variable
 higrade).
 During this period, we define high school graduates as those completing
 12 years of schooling (higrade=150), college dropouts as those with less
 than four years of college (151,...,181), and college graduates as those with
 16+ years of schooling (190 and above).
 Beginning in 1992, the CPS reports education according to the highest degree
 attained (educ99).
 For this period, we define high school graduates as those with a high school
 diploma or GED (educ99=10), college dropouts as those with "some college
 no degree," "associate degree/occupational program," "associate degree/academic
 program" (11,12,13,14).
 College graduates are those with a bachelors, masters, professional, or
 doctorate degree (15,16,17,18).

\begin_layout Subsection
Lifetime earnings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lifetime earnings = present value of earnings up to age 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsAgeWorkLast$
\end_inset

.
 Discounted at model interest rate to age 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsAgeOne$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each school group: assume work start ages of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\cpsAgeWorkStartV\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earnings: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
wage and salary income (INCWAGE), deflated by the Consumer Price Index with
 a base year of 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsCpiBaseYear$
\end_inset

.
 Top coded observations of INCWAGE are multiplied by 1.5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drop outliers: Define a weekly wage as INCWAGE per week worked (WKSWORK2),
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observations with wages below 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsWageMinFactor$
\end_inset

 times the median wage or above 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpsWageMaxFactor$
\end_inset

 times the median (strictly positive) wage are dropped as outliers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constructing a cohort's earnings profile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where observed, use median earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where not observed: impute using the predicted age-earnings profile obtained
 by regressing log median earnings on age and year dummies (pooling all
 cohorts; separately for each school group).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To match levels: adjust mean of profile to match cohort's mean over 5 years
 where observed (at start or end of profile).
